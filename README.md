# Agentic Calculator using LangChain

- a "beginner-friendly agentic AI system" built using 'LangChain', 'Google Gemini', and 'Streamlit'.

The goal of this project is "learn how agent-based systems work" using LangChain.


# Project Overview

Instead of one AI doing everything, this project uses "multiple specialized agents":

- ➕ Addition Agent  
- ➖ Subtraction Agent  
- ✖️ Multiplication Agent  
- ➗ Division Agent  

Each agent is implemented as a "LangChain Tool" with its own logic written in Python.

The LLM (Gemini) is used only to decide which agent should be called, not to perform calculations.
